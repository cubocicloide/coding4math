In order to install these dependencies in an Ubuntu machine, run the following commands in a terminal window (in this case, the terminal is opened in the folder where the project is located, e.g., \nproject-directory\n):\n\n\n\u279c  project-directory    sudo apt-get install g++\n\u279c  project-directory    sudo apt-get install libeigen3-dev\n\u279c  project-directory    sudo apt-get install liballegro4.2\u2010dev\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompilation instruction\n\n\nOnce that the above dependencies has been installed, the program can be compiled by means of the \nmakefile\n.
