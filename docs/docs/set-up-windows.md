<!-- ------
## Requirements

This project has been tested in Ubuntu (version 14.04), and needs the following dependencies: [g++], [eigen3] and [allegro4]. In order to install these dependencies in an Ubuntu machine, run the following commands in a terminal window (in this case, the terminal is opened in the folder where the project is located, e.g., `project-directory`):

```zsh
➜  project-directory    sudo apt-get install g++
➜  project-directory    sudo apt-get install libeigen3-dev
➜  project-directory    sudo apt-get install liballegro4.2‐dev
```

---
## Compilation instruction
Once that the above dependencies has been installed, the program can be compiled by means of the `makefile`. More precisely, it will be sufficient to run the following command in the terminal:

```zsh
➜  project-directory    make
```

```python
print('Hello World')
```

---
## Run the program
After the compilation, the `makefile` can be used to run the program, as follows:

```zsh
➜  project-directory    make run
```

**Notes**

1. The program needs sudo privileges to be executed.

2. The `makefile` can also be used to clean the program, in this case just run the command:

```zsh
➜  project-directory    make clean
```

## Further informations
For a detailed description of the project structure see the [docs]. 
$$
\begin{align}\tag{1}
\label{eq:pythagoras}
x^2 + y^2 = z^2
\end{align} 
$$

As we can see from $\eqref{eq:pythagoras}$ all is well in Denmark.
